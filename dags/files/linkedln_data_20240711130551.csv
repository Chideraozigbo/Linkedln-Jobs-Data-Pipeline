GEO is a science-driven benefit corporation whose civic mission is to accelerate the clean energy transition by informing decisions and business practices with transparent, objective analysis using advanced geospatial technology and AI.\nThe Technical InnovationThe proposed technical innovation is a computationally efficient, tiered multi-satellite monitoring system that tracks daily-to-weekly CH4 emissions from oil & gas assets across the globe, which are then used to assess company-level emission performance and benchmark companies amongst their peers. The technology integrates satellite observations from multiple sensors, deep learning models, and statistical data aggregation. A crucial component is a deep learning model which automatically detects CH4 plumes in high-resolution imagery from satellites not designed to detect methane, like the Landsat suite and Sentinel-2. These plumes are used to refine TROPOMI (Sentinel-5p) baseline observations. Most quantification methods, and deep learning models in particular, are too computationally expensive to use at a global scale. Thus innovative, computationally efficient methods for emission quantification and statistical data aggregation must be developed.\nThe Broader Impact of This WorkThe broader/commercial impact of this NSF-funded project is that methane, with its global warming potential 85 times that of carbon dioxide over a 20-year period, represents a critical target in the fight against climate change. If successful, the proposed innovation could play a pivotal role in mitigating methane emissions, contributing significantly to global climate goals. Specifically, the proposed intervention could help flatten the methane emissions curve – cutting emissions of US oil & gas producers by 75% over five years. This 75% reduction in emissions from fossil fuels aligns with the International Energy Agency’s goal for 2030 that would enable limiting global warming to 1.5°C. Lower methane emissions translate into improved air quality, reducing respiratory illnesses and other health issues associated with air pollution. Additionally, decreased global warming mitigates the frequency and severity of climate-related disasters such as wildfires, floods, and heatwaves. These changes have profound implications for biodiversity, ecosystems, and human livelihoods, particularly in vulnerable regions which includes much of the US.\nYour Role and ResponsibilitiesYou will be a key member of the GEO’s R&D team to support algorithm development and other related activities for assessing and benchmarking methane emissions from various ground sources using a combination of ground- and satellite-based techniques. These algorithms and workflows will be further operationalized and automated to support continuous monitoring of methane. A successful candidate will have at a minimum a master’s degree in computer science/data science or chemical/physical/biological sciences with deep computer or data science expertise with prior experience in data science/data engineering. Experience in SQL and scientific scripting using Python is also desired.The work is fast-paced, highly iterative, and continuously trading off between what works and what is best. R&D typically involves rigorous testing and fact checking at every step of the way. If you enjoy working with data to build products and solve hard real-world environmental problems in creative ways, you will fit right in.\nJob Duties & ResponsibilitiesParticipate as an integral team member to develop an innovative computationally efficient, tiered multi-satellite monitoring system.
